To understand the traditional shift testing, we must first understand the traditional SDLC VModel, which emphasizes, acceptance and system-level testing, on testing from lower down on 
the right side of the V-model.
Whereas Traditional Shift-Left Testing emphasizes unit testing and integration testing, this is 
done using API testing and automated testing tools.
2) Incremental Shift Left Testing
This is a suitable approach for large software companies and projects with complex designs and 
development.
The tasks are broken into smaller segments that are built on each other with an increment.
After each increment is delivered to a customer and operation team, then the developing and 
testing incrementally shifts to the left, which helps testers to run test case scenarios on each 
individual bit making it easier to identify and fix the potential risks.
3) DevOps/Agile Shift Left Testing
This kind of software testing approach is practiced to run continuous tests on the number of 
sprints via an evolutionary development life cycle, like DNA.
It is mainly done for development testing only once when the system is operational.
